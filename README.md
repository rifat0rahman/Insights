# Insights

#### This is a data analytics app by django.

I build this app just to fun and implement some of the learnig from pandas and matplotlib with djagno.This is not the best I had planned for.There might be some other options I could
pick up but I wanted to do this types of app with python so I did.But if I had to do something for real I would pick anything for graph charting that macthed well with web.

### Features

1. Able to see your csv file into web app clearly.(now only taking csv).
2. Able to customize rows
3. You can see insights of your data
4. Able to vizualise your data with Three different graph charts
5. You can select columns and mini analytics to your data.

### Graphs
1. Line plot
2. Scatter with line mapping
3. Histogram

### Tools
1. python
2. Django (main tool)
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib (for the graphs)
5. Numpy


I have a great plan to build something like that.But I found matplotlib not the best for this kind of web project.You can use matplotlib with jupyter thats one of the great tool
to analytics manually.But with web it is slower.I will try a cms for analytic latter with something that goes well to websites. Thank you.
